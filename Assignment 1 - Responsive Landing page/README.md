In this assignment i am using breakpoint to made it responsive.<br/>
Breakpoint in Tailwind CSS refers to a specific viewport size at which the layout or design of a website or application changes to adapt to different screen sizes. <br/>
In this assignment breakpoint is `md` that width start from	`768px`	`@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }`<br/>
We are designing for mobile and move to medium and large screen.
